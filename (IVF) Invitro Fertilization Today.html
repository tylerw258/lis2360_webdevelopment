 <p>Envision you and your spouse are planning to have a baby, and with the tremendous trove of quality altering advances that have surfaced, your doctors introduce a shocking recommendation, they guarantee to modify hair, skin, and eye color, and in addition take out any pathology, sickness, or innate disabilities that may harm your child.
 </p>
 <p>The efficient and compelling CRISPR method for adjusting DNA has made engineering genes similar to reordering characters in a Microsoft Word doc. It is now beneath $1,000 for a human genome to be sequenced, a process that tells scientists the kind of genetic information that is carried in a particular DNA segment. The price for this sequencing is expected to fall underneath $100 throughout the following couple of years. With less expensive quality sequencing, the cost of looking into hereditary attributes will dive. Parents  will likewise be able to all the more precisely break down the pluses and minuses of different developing lives and select the one that has the best blend of probabilities for in vitro treatment (IVF), a process of fertilization where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body, in vitro. Another strategy important to this topic is called preimplantation hereditary analysis (PGD), this strategy is utilized to enable couples to recognize fetuses that may have high dangers of major hereditary ailments, for example, asthma.</p>
 <p> IVF joined with PGD and an improved CRISPR treatment, could turn into a luxury treatment for affluent people looking for an edge for their offspring.  Furthermore, future advances in technology and computations should enable researchers to better comprehend the intricate relationship between genes and how they are expressed. Deciding the relationship of hereditary genes to characteristics like book smarts is a math issue that will presumably never have a correct answer, however given time it can be enhanced to give more exact probabilities.
