        <h1> God of the Seas</h1>
        <p> As far back as I can remember Poseidon has been my favorite Olympian god.
        Though not quite as known as his thunderbolt toting elder brother Zeus, he’s still an undeniable part of “The Big Three”, the most powerful Olympian gods.
        Poseidon is the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses.</p>
        <p>The meaning of his name and his Roman counterpart Neptune, perhaps derived from the Greek words ποσις (posis) "husband,
        lord" and δα (da) earth", and the Latin “Neptunus” has been a topic of speculation among scholars since its earliest discovery in ancient clay Linear B tablets.
        As one of the “Big Three” in terms of jurisdiction and power in the Olympian pantheon, Poseidon is second only to Zeus.
        However, his worshippers made it a point to appease the god with sacrifices, various temples, and offerings since most were seafaring and would’ve been at his mercy.
        This is especially true for his Roman counterpart Neptune whom by about 1 BC had supplanted the Roman god Fortunus as the god responsible for Roman naval victories.</p>
        <p>Unlike many gods in Greek mythology Poseidon’s’ name has no direct translation that is agreed on in either it’s Roman or Greek forms. Found in early Linear B tablets in Pylos,
        Poseidon’s name was often associated with the title Wanax, as being king of the underworld and appearing more times in the Linear B tablets than even Zeus.
        However, most scholars agree that his name must have been derived from the Greek words ποσις (posis) "husband, lord" and δα (da) "earth",
        while his Roman name Neptune has no real traces of meaning in the name.</p>
