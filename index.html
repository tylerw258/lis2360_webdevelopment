<h1>IVF Today</h1>
<h2><em>Overview</h2></em>
    <p> Envision you and your spouse are planning to have a baby, and with the tremendous trove of quality altering advances that have surfaced, your doctors introduce a shocking recommendation, they guarantee to modify hair, skin, and eye color, and in addition take out any pathology, sickness, or innate disabilities that may harm your child.</p>
    <p>The efficient and compelling CRISPR method for adjusting DNA has made engineering genes similar to reordering characters in a Microsoft Word doc. It is now beneath $1,000 for a human genome to be sequenced, a process that tells scientists the kind of genetic information that is carried in a particular DNA segment. The price for this sequencing is expected to fall underneath $100 throughout the following couple of years. With less expensive quality sequencing, the cost of looking into hereditary attributes will dive. Parents  will likewise be able to all the more precisely break down the pluses and minuses of different developing lives and select the one that has the best blend of probabilities for in vitro treatment (IVF), a process of fertilization where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body, in vitro. Another strategy important to this topic is called preimplantation hereditary analysis (PGD), this strategy is utilized to enable couples to recognize fetuses that may have high dangers of major hereditary ailments, for example, asthma.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Step 1</td></td>
    <td> Your doctor prescribes a course of drugs for you to take to stimulate your ovaries into hopefully producing 12 to 15 mature eggs.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Step 2</td>
    <td>You receive a light general anaesthetic for a short procedure where your doctor retrieves your eggs using an ultrasound guided technique.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Step 3</td>
    <td>On the day of egg collection, your partner or choice of donor provides a sperm sample.The embryologist puts sperm and eggs together in the lab and, if all goes well, the eggs fertilise and early embryo development begins.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Step 4</td>
    <td>Embryos at each subsequent stage of development are grown in media similar to what they would encounter as they make their way down the tube into the uterus.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Step 5</td>
    <td>Two to five days after egg collection, your doctor places the eggs in the uterus. Two weeks later you'll be tested to see if the treatment worked and if you're pregnant.</td>
  </tr>
